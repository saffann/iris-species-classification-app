# Iris Species Classification App

Classify iris flowers in real time with a PyTorch model and see predictions on an Arduino LED matrix by entering measurements via the web interface.

## Description

The App uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network trained on the classic Iris dataset to predict iris species from four input measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Users can enter measurements through a web interface, and the prediction is visualized on the 8 x 13 LED matrix with unique flower patterns for each species.

The `assets` folder contains the **frontend** components of the application, including the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the web user interface. The `python` folder contains the application **backend** with model inference and WebUI handling. The Arduino sketch manages LED matrix display.

## Bricks Used

The Iris Species Classification App uses the following Bricks:

- `arduino:web_ui`: Brick to create a web interface for inputting iris measurements and displaying predictions.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

### Hardware

- Arduino UNO Q (x1)
- USB-C® cable (for power and programming) (x1)

### Software

- Arduino App Lab
- PyTorch (for neural network inference)

**Note:** You can also run this example using your Arduino UNO Q as a Single Board Computer (SBC) using a [USB-C® hub](https://store.arduino.cc/products/usb-c-to-hdmi-multiport-adapter-with-ethernet-and-usb-hub) with a mouse, keyboard and display attached.

## How to Use the Example

### Clone the Example

1. Clone the example to your workspace.

### Run the App

1. Click the **Run** button in App Lab to start the application.
2. Open the App in your browser at `<UNO-Q-IP-ADDRESS>:7000`
3. Enter the four iris measurements (must be floats with decimal points, e.g., `5.1`, not `5`)
4. Click **Predict Species** to see the result

### Input Validation

The web interface validates that all inputs are proper floats:
- Integers are rejected (e.g., `5` must be entered as `5.0`)
- Text/strings are rejected
- Valid format examples: `5.1`, `3.5`, `1.4`, `0.2`

### Example Measurements

Try these sample measurements to test each species prediction:

| Species | Sepal Length | Sepal Width | Petal Length | Petal Width |
|---------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Setosa | 5.1 | 3.5 | 1.4 | 0.2 |
| Versicolor | 5.9 | 2.8 | 4.3 | 1.3 |
| Virginica | 6.6 | 3.0 | 5.5 | 2.0 |

## How it Works

Once the application is running, the device performs the following operations:

- **Serving the web interface and handling WebSocket communication.**

  The `web_ui` Brick provides the web server and WebSocket communication:

  ```python
  from arduino.app_bricks.web_ui import WebUI

  ui = WebUI()
  ui.on_message("predict", on_predict)
  ```

- **Loading the trained PyTorch model.**

  The application loads a pre-trained MLP model for iris classification:

  ```python
  from arduino.app_utils import *
  import torch
  import torch.nn as nn

  model = Model().to(DEVICE)
  model.load_state_dict(torch.load("/app/python/iris_model.pth", map_location=DEVICE))
  model.eval()
  ```

  The model is automatically loaded when the application starts and is ready to make predictions.

- **Making predictions based on input measurements.**

  The `predict_iris()` function takes four measurements and returns the predicted species:

  ```python
  def predict_iris(sepal_length: float, sepal_width: float, petal_length: float, petal_width: float) -> str:
      features = [sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width]
      X_new = torch.tensor(features).float().to(DEVICE)
      logits = model(X_new)
      predicted_class = logits.argmax(dim=1).item()
      return SPECIES_MAP[predicted_class]
  ```

  The model outputs one of three species: `setosa`, `versicolor`, or `virginica`.

- **Handling web interface predictions and updating the LED matrix.**

  When a user submits measurements through the web interface:

  ```python
  def on_predict(client, data):
      species = predict_iris(data["sepal_length"], data["sepal_width"], 
                             data["petal_length"], data["petal_width"])
      ui.send_message("prediction_result", {"species": species})
      Bridge.call("display_species", species)
  ```

- **Displaying species patterns on the LED matrix.**

  The sketch receives the species and displays the corresponding pattern:

  ```cpp
  void display_species(String species) {
    if (species == "setosa") loadFrame8x13(setosa);
    else if (species == "versicolor") loadFrame8x13(versicolor);
    else if (species == "virginica") loadFrame8x13(virginica);
    else loadFrame8x13(unknown);
  }
  ```

The high-level data flow looks like this:

```
Web Browser Input → WebSocket → Python Backend → PyTorch Model → Router Bridge → LED Matrix
```
, predictions, and web interface communication.

- **`ui = WebUI()`**: Initializes the web server that serves the HTML interface and handles WebSocket communication.

- **`ui.on_message("predict", on_predict)`**: Registers a WebSocket message handler that responds when the user submits measurements.

- **`ui.send_message("prediction_result", ...)`**: Sends prediction results to the web client in real-time.

- **`SPECIES_MAP`**: Dictionary mapping class indices to species names (0 = setosa, 1 = versicolor, 2 = virginica).

- **`DEVICE`**: Automatically selects the best available compute device (CUDA, MPS, or CPU).

- **`Model`**: A feedforward neural network class with two hidden layers (8 neurons each) and optional dropout for regularization.

- **`predict_iris()`**: Takes four float measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width), runs inference through the model, and returns the predicted species name.

- **`Bridge.call("display_species", species)`**: Calls the Arduino function to update the LED matrix display.

### 🔧 Frontend (`index.html` + `app.js`)

The web interface provides a form for entering iris measurements with validation.

- **Socket.IO connection**: Establishes WebSocket communication with the Python backend through the `web_ui` Brick.

- **`socket.emit("predict", data)`**: Sends measurement data to the backend when the user clicks the predict button.

- **`socket.on("prediction_result", ...)`**: Receives prediction results and updates the UI accordingly.

- **`isValidFloat()`**: Validates that inputs are proper floats (rejects integers and strings).

### 🔧 Hardware (`sketch.ino`)

The Arduino code is focused on hardware management. It receives species names and displays them on the LED matrix.

- **`matrix.begin()`**: Initializes the matrix driver, making the LED display ready to show patterns.

- **`Bridge.begin()`**: Opens the serial communication bridge to the host Python® runtime.

- **`Bridge.provide("display_species", display_species)`**: Registers the display function to be callable from Python.

- **`display_species(String species)`**: Receives the predicted species and displays the corresponding 8 × 13 frame on the LED matrix
The Arduino code is focused on hardware management. It requests predictions and displays them.

- **`matrix.begin()`**: Initializes the matrix driver, making the LED display ready to show patterns.

- **`Bridge.begin()`**: Opens the serial communication bridge to the host Python® runtime.

- **`loop()`**: Once per second, calls the Python® function with iris measurements, selects the corresponding 8 × 13 frame (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`, or `unknown`), and shows it with `loadFrame8x13(frame)`.

- **`iris_frames.h`**: Header file that stores the pixel patterns for each iris species:
  - **Setosa**: Small diamond flower pattern
  - **Versicolor**: Medium cross-shaped flower pattern  
  - **Virginica**: Large starburst flower pattern
  - **Unknown**: Question mark for error cases

### 🔧 Model Training (`I-MLP.ipynb`)

The Jupyter notebook contains the complete model training pipeline:

- **Data Loading**: Loads the Iris dataset from `iris.csv`
- **Data Preprocessing**: Splits data into training and testing sets
- **Model Definition**: Defines the MLP architecture
- **Training Loop**: Trains the model using cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer
- **Model Export**: Saves the trained weights to `iris_model.pth`

## Neural Network Architecture

The MLP model consists of:

- **fc1**: Input (4) → Output (8), ReLU activation
- **fc2**: Input (8) → Output (8), ReLU activation  
- **out**: Input (8) → Output (3), Softmax activation

The model takes 4 input features (sepal/petal measurements) and outputs probabilities for 3 iris species.
